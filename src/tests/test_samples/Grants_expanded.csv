The individual levothyroxine dose requirement varies highly between patients. This variation may partly be caused by changes in the absorption of levothyroxine due to simultaneous intake of drugs. We hypothesize that levothyroxine transporters in the intestine facilitate levothyroxine uptake, and that some drugs may block this uptake resulting in reduced absorption of levothyroxine. In healthy subjects, we will study the effect of ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic, and imatinib, a cancer drug, on thyroid hormone absorption, and compare with the effect of rifampin, a known blocker of transporter proteins. These studies will help to elucidate the role of intestinal transporters in levothyroxine absorption.

Background Performing colonoscopy requires advanced technical skill that requires significant time to learn and master. Traditional methods of learning this procedure involve trainees performing colonoscopy on real patients under the close supervision of a fully qualified endoscopist. Certainly this approach is laden with many potential issues. Patients have indicated dissatisfaction with procedures performed by trainees particularly early in the training period. An increased frequency of minor adverse events associated with colonoscopy in this setting has also been described. (1) Finally, new trainees generally require a significant amount of time and instruction, which is a challenge when practicing physicians are faced with increased pressure to perform more procedures with limited endoscopy time. One study estimated fellow involvement in endoscopy resulted in an increased procedure time of up to 37%. (2) The financial impact this may have on both the institution and clinician can be significant. With the advancement of computer technology however, there now exists several virtual reality endoscopy simulators that hold promise in terms of overcoming some of these challenges. The two commercially available simulators on the market today are the Immersion Medical AccuTouch Endoscopy Simulator and the Simbionix GI Mentor II. Although there are some significant differences between them, both allow the user to practice both upper and lower GI endoscopy through a number of different simulated cases. The potential advantages are obvious. As there are no real patients involved, the potential for dissatisfaction or complications is removed. As well, time constraints are no longer an issue as the trainee can spend as much time as needed working through the modules. While completing the modules, the clinician can be free to perform more endoscopies. The major limitation in implementing widespread use of the simulators is cost. Currently available systems range in price from $50,000 to $100,000. (3) Several validation studies of the simulators have been performed to date. Initial studies primarily evaluated expert validity (does the simulator provide a realistic representation of colonoscopy according to experts) and also construct validity (can the simulator distinguish between different levels of expertise). These studies have shown that experts perform significantly better on the simulator than do novices, as one would expect if the simulators provide a realistic representation of colonoscopy. (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) The final, and perhaps most important type of validity, is predictive validity (does performance on the simulator correlate with performance in real life). To date, there are only two studies that have evaluated this.

Long-term HPA axis activation can lead to a variety of stress-related disorders. Thus it is of crucial biological importance to assess long-term levels of cortisol. Conventional tests of cortisol in saliva, serum or urine samples provide only an immediate estimate of cortisol levels and are limited to prospective measurement. A promising alternative is hair cortisol. Hair cortisol is not affected by diurnal variation and can be sectioned to examine cortisol production over a period of several months. This pilot study will investigate if hair cortisol levels, as a biomarker for chronic stress, are elevated in adults with a stress-related disorder, and determine the relation between degree of perceived psychological stress and hair cortisol levels over the corresponding period. Using a case control study design, 116 adult patients with temporomandibular joint disorder will be recruited along with 116 pain-free controls. All subjects will complete the Perceived Stress Scale using a reference interval of the past three months. At a clinic visit research staff will cut 1.25 inches of hair closest to the scalp (~ 100 strands, ? 20mg of hair) from the vertex posterior region. Analysis of 1.25"" of hair represents three months’ systemic cortisol exposure, corresponding to three months HPA axis activity. Findings will support planning of a large-scale epidemiologic project to elucidate causal pathways linking chronic stress in adverse social living conditions (e.g. unemployment, family disruption, discrimination) to stress-related health disorders.

In recent years however, clear evidence has emerged to suggest membrane transporters are critically important. For example, Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide (OATP) transporters expressed on the basolateral domain of hepatocytes appear to be key mediators that facilitate the uptake of drugs from the portal circulation into liver. Indeed, studies from our laboratory and others have shown that the hepatic OATPs are critical to the disposition and efficacy of clinical important pharmaceuticals, including the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) class of drugs. However, little is known regarding the molecular basis of hepatic OATP drug substrate specificity, regulated expression, or the extent of variation in their activity in humans. The overall hypothesis is that regulated expression and function of human OATP1B1 and 1B3 transporters are key determinants of observed variable drug responsiveness in humans. Accordingly, a step-wise and systematic study involving in vitro functional characterization, the creation of animal models, and proof-of-principle in vivo studies is proposed based on 3 Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the molecular basis for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrate specificity. Specifically, utilizing a novel method based on the homologous recombination of linear plasmid DNA by E. coli, we have generated of a library of monomer length OATP1B1-1B3 and OATP1B3-1B1 random chimeras in a tandem head-to-tail configuration. Using a high-throughput heterologous gene expression system we will determine the transport activity of these chimeric transporters that possess variable chimeric junctions which span the length of its cDNA sequence, to systematically determine and identify the key region(s) or amino acid(s) in OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 that confer substrate specificity. For Specific Aim 2, we will determine the pharmacological and physiological relevance of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vivo through transgenic expression of human OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in the Oatp1b2 (gene name Slco1b2) knockout mice. We now have preliminary data from studies using the Oatp1b2 knock-out mice that suggest a functional relevance of murine Oatp1b2 to hepatic drug disposition. However, given the species-associated difference among OATP1B transporter subfamily members, to truly delineate the clinical relevance of human OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, we will utilize the Oatp1b2 knockout mice to transgenically express human OATP1B1 and 1B3 as a more desirable in vivo model for determining the pharmacological impact of the human hepatic OATP transporters to drug disposition. In Specific Aim 3, we will assess the role of nuclear receptors LXR? and FXR in the transcriptional regulation of OATP1B1 (gene name SLCO1B1) and assess their impact on OATP1B1 activity in vitro and in vivo. Our preliminary studies strongly indicate that the nuclear receptors LXR? and FXR are involved in the",Operating,Research,Richard B. Kim,Rommel G. Tirona George K.

Many drugs in clinical use, such as the oral anticoagulant (blood thinning drug) warfarin, have a narrow margin of safety, and require frequent monitoring or dose adjustments. Personalized medicine represents the integration of data in relation to a patient’s genetic makeup, specifically Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes that affect drug disposition or response, together with environmental influences and disease states to identify more precise treatment options for an individual patient. In this application, a practical “real world” assessment of the role and relevance of SNPs in the genes responsible for warfarin metabolism (CYP2C9) and the target for warfarin effect (VKORC1) is proposed, through the synergistic collaboration between researchers with complementary expertise in pharmacogenomics and anticoagulation therapy. Specifically an optimal algorithm for warfarin therapy which includes CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes will be identified and studied in our hospital- and outpatient-based populations, to test the hypothesis that individualized therapy for warfarin that includes such genomic information will reduce the time needed to reach desired level of anticoagulation and the bleeding risk from excess warfarin effect. The key benefit from this research for Ontario is the potential of this proposal to generate a new paradigm for managing our patients on warfarin that will save health care delivery costs, while increasing the overall quality of life for our patients by reducing unnecessary or unexpected clinic visits and the number of bleeding related hospitalizations.",Operating,Research,Richard B.

Powerful analytical technologies for the detection of an array of drug and drug metabolites now also exist. However, focused application of such technologies based on new and emerging mechanistic insights to the delivery of care to our patients with cancer has yet to be realized. Of particular concern relates to our elderly patients who are more often afflicted with cancer and are far more vulnerable to the side-effects and toxicity to chemotherapy. Accordingly, the intent of the proposed research is to integrate and apply our existing and emerging knowledge relating to the chemotherapeutic agent irinotecan (CPT-11), a widely utilized drug for the treatment of colon cancer in the elderly. We are uniquely poised to utilize the latest generation of customized DNA genotyping technologies and a state-of-the-art LC-tandem mass spectrometry platform (awarded to the PI of this application from a CFI Leaders Opportunity Fund) for the simultaneous detection of irinotecan and its metabolites from a single biological sample in near real-time. Data obtained from the proposed study of “real world” patients will enhance our ability to identify the right dose of irinotecan for the right patient at the right time. Importantly, the objectives outlined in this proposal are fully consistent with Lawson research directions in terms of the focus on Pharmacogenomics/Personalized Medicine and Clinical Investigation and Therapeutics. The benefit for London and Canada in general is the potential of this proposal to generate new paradigms for the dosing of cancer chemotherapy agents, as well as many other drugs on the market where variable toxicity or efficacy due to interpatient factors remains a major stumbling block to optimal pharmacotherapy. Furthermore, implementation of knowledge gained from this proposal has the potential to save health care delivery costs through improved utilization of existing chemotherapy agents and also reduce unexpected adverse response, deaths, and hospitalizations.",Operating,Research,Richard B.

However, there is considerable interindividual variability in response to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) therapy regarding both efficacy and toxicity. Variable responses to medications are influenced, at least in part, by frequent human genetic variants that affect drug metabolism and drug disposition. Because suboptimal response can have devastating consequences for individuals and populations, defining the predictive value of human genetics for HIV treatment response has far-reaching implications. The pace of genomic discovery relevant to HIV therapeutics has been relatively slow and fragmented. Efficiently moving HIV pharmacogenomics from bench to bedside to community will be greatly facilitated by an approach that spans antiretroviral drugs and drug classes so that persons affected by HIV worldwide may benefit from the human genomic revolution. The proposed studies will determine the utility of human pharmacogenomic testing for clinical HIV care. The overarching hypothesis is that knowledge of associations between human genetic variants and HIV treatment responses will improve HIV treatment outcomes. This proposal will focus on genes relevant to drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME), complemented by selected non-ADME polymorphisms. This will be accomplished through analyses of data and DNA from over 5,000 participants from prospective clinical trials. Predictive models for responses to antiretroviral therapies will be developed based on knowledge of human genetic variants. Results of these analyses may also inform the design of a prospective randomized clinical trial to test whether HIV treatment responses will improve when human genetic testing informs prescribing. This work may ultimately result in better individualized therapy (personalized medicine), and improved antiretroviral treatment guidelines for persons living in resource-limited countries worldwide. To maximize impact and value added, this project will be a platform for collaboration with other investigators.",Operating,Research,David Haas,,,* UWO,National Institutes of Health (NIH) (USA),,CAD = Canadian dollar,,"$42,032,866.00","$23,333.00",,0,4.00,,1,False,,,

Rarely, potentially life-threatening skeletal muscle toxicities including rhabdomyolysis can occur with statin therapy. While increased dose and co-medication with drugs that cause metabolic and transporter-mediated drug-statin interactions are predisposing factors to muscle injury, neither plasma statin levels nor physicochemical drug properties completely explain this increased risk. We hypothesize that the expression, function and interplay between uptake and efflux drug transporters in muscle determines susceptibility to statin-induced myopathies. Indeed, our preliminary findings indicate the presence of several drug transporters in human skeletal muscle including the uptake transporter Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 2B1 (OATP2B1) as well as the efflux transporter Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 4 (MRP4), both of which we demonstrate are capable of transporting rosusvastatin. Our initial experiments in vitro using cultured, differentiated human skeletal myoblasts indicate that inhibition of MRP function enhances cellular accumulation of statins and potentiates their toxicity. In the mouse in vivo, we observe that rosuvastatin readily enters the skeletal muscle and achieves local concentrations that are less than that found in blood. Furthermore, we have identified a number of naturally occurring genetic variants of OATP2B1 and MRP4 among Caucasians, which if found to have altered transport activity, may impact achieved muscle statin levels during therapy. Therefore, in this application we outline studies that test the overall hypothesis that expression and variable function of transporters in muscle are critical determinants of statin-induced myopathies.",Operating,Research,Rommel G.

The individual levothyroxine dose requirement varies highly between patients. This variation may partly be caused by changes in the absorption of levothyroxine due to simultaneous intake of drugs. We hypothesize that levothyroxine transporters in the intestine facilitate levothyroxine uptake, and that some drugs may block this uptake resulting in reduced absorption of levothyroxine. In healthy subjects, we will study the effect of ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic, on thyroid hormone absorption, and compare with the effect of rifampin, a known blocker of transporter proteins. These studies will help to elucidate the role of intestinal transporters in levothyroxine absorption. It is expected that an improved understanding of the role of transporters in levothyroxine uptake and metabolism may decrease health risks due to under- or over hormone replacement.",Operating,Research,,"Rommel Tirona, Richard Kim",,,LHRI-IRF,,CAD = Canadian dollar,,"$54,404,955.00",,Cash,0,,,0,False,,,

In Canada CVD is the leading cause of death (32% of all deaths; 72,000/yr) and hospitalizations (~15% of all hospitalizations; 430,000/yr) 1. Health Canada indicates that the majority of costs associated with CVD is incurred by individuals 34-65 years of age and involves direct costs of clinical care (~20%) and long-term loss of production (disability; ~80%). These costs do not include other challenges to mobility such as autonomic nervous system dysregulation2, 3, impairments to cognition4, mood5, gait, motor control6 or osteoporosis7 where vascular disease is now hypothesized to be a common etiology. 2) Patient adherence to lifestyle change: Physical inactivity and low physical fitness remain major risk factors for CVD and are associated with a two-fold increase in risk of cardiovascular mortality8. Physical activity is also a major treatment for CVD. Yet, greater numbers of adults and youth do not engage in regular physical activity every year9 and achieving long-term adherence to regular physical exercise remains a major challenge that is related to patient motives and limitations in physician expertise and resources. To this end, this Team will address the call in the Romanow Report (2002), and the recent Annual Report to Canadians, 2006 (Canadian Health Council), to reduce physical inactivity, produce team-building approaches in health care delivery, and provide evidence that can be used to educate health care providers and patients. Overall Objectives: a) To understand the impact of vascular disease on structural and functional properties of somatosensory and autonomic nerves involved in muscular work. b) To determine whether exercise interventions that are known to reduce the risk for, or magnitude of, vascular disease, also lead to positive adaptations of nerves in the brain, spinal cord and the periphery that affect motor and cardiovascular control. Working Hypothesis: Interdependency exists between nerves and their blood supply such that vascular disease produces widespread impairments in neural systems regulating muscular control and the delivery of blood to nerves by the circulatory system. This hypothesis unifies independent observations of impairments in motor control and the autonomic nervous system in patients with CVD, and leads to the following sub-hypotheses: a) Vascular disease interferes with normal coordination of somatosensory and autonomic nervous system networks in the central nervous system. b) Vascular disease is detrimental to the blood supply of nervous tissues that support coordination of skeletal muscle and cardiovascular responses to exercise. c) A physically active lifestyle that improves vascular health also will improve functional and morphological aspects of nerves involved in the support of mobility. Overall Approaches: A “deficit” model will be employed where the starting point is vascular disease and where secondary prevention strategies incorporating exercise and diet aim to improve vascular health and neural function related to muscle engagement. For the purposes of this program, human vascular disease is defined as coronary artery disease (CAD) as this condition is based on specified impairments and leads to prescribed rehabilitation strategies. Many patients with CAD also have diabetes mellitus (DM) that aggravates peripheral vascular and neural impairment. To address and examine comprehensively our hypotheses, both human and rodent models of disease will be used. Experimental approaches in Zucker lean, obese and diabetic rats will enable a biophysical and subcellular mechanistic assessment of neural adaptations to disease and exercise interventions; Zucker obese rats provide a model of vascular impairment without diabetes. Rodent studies provide the CIHR Team in Physical Activity, Mobility and Neural Health Principal Applicant: J. K. Shoemaker RESEARCH PROPOSAL Year 1 Budget: $487,124 12 b opportunity for acute and prospective mechanistic and experimental studies that will run in parallel to the human studies. Cross-sectional and prospective designs in human studies will provide integrative observations regarding the impact of age, vascular disease and exercise training on neural and vascular properties in the brain and periphery. Community-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs will be integrated into the research model to produce information exchange between patient, clinician and research elements along with incorporation of training programs in Clinical Kinesiology (CK) with expertise in translation and delivery of knowledge regarding exercise and nutritional lifestyle changes to patie",Operating,Research,Kevin Shoemaker,,,* CIHR,CIHR,,CAD = Canadian dollar,,"$18,742,081.00","$76,200.00",Cash,0,,,0,False,False,,

Despite considerable advances in diagnosis and treatment of AKI, mortality rates remain largely unchanged. Severe AKI caused by circulatory collapse or medications that are toxic to the kidney can result in massive death of kidney epithelial cells. The rapid removal of dead cells occurs through a process known as ""phagocytosis"" that is vital to preventing further inflammation and for hastening tissue repair. Recently, we and other scientists discovered that injured kidney epithelial cells express KIM-1, a gene product that transforms surviving kidney epithelial cells into phagocytes that are able to clear the dead or dying cells from the injured kidney. Emerging experimental evidence suggests that genetically engineered mice lacking the ability to remove dead cells owing to a mutation in the KIM-1 gene are more susceptible to inflammation and kidney dysfunction after AKI. Our research aims to understand the complex cell signalling pathways that govern how KIM-1 enables kidney epithelial cells to perform phagocytosis and regulate inflammation during AKI. Our studies culminate in the development and testing of a novel therapeutic strategy aimed at enhancing this (KIM-1 dependent) kidney protective mechanism that already exists in all humans.

Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) that results when there is temporary cessation and re-establishment of blood flow to the kidney is the most common cause of AKI. IRI is also an inevitable consequence of organ transplantation that, when severe, can limit the lifespan of the transplanted organ. Despite modern therapies, mortality rates and the poor outcomes after kidney transplantation associatednwith IRI remain largely unchanged. At the cellular level, IRI leads to massive death of kidney epithelial cells. The rapid removal of these dead cells occurs through a process known as ""phagocytosis"" that is vital to preventing further inflammation and hastening tissue repair. Recently, groups including ours discovered that surviving kidney epithelial cells express KIM-1, a gene product that transforms surviving kidney epithelial cells into phagocytes for clearance of dead or dying cells from the injured kidney. Emerging experimental evidence suggests that genetically engineered mice lacking the KIM-1 gene are more susceptible to inflammation and kidney dysfunction after IRI. Our research aims to understand the complex cell signalling pathways that govern how KIM-1 converts kidney epithelial cells to perform phagocytosis. In addition, we will test a novel therapeutic strategy that exploits this KIM-1-dependent kidney protective mechanism to enhance clearance of dead cells to ameliorate IRI in an animal model. We hope that our studies will lead to development of novel therapeutic strategies to improve renal recovery and potentially improve outcomes in AKI patients and kidney transplant recipients",Salary Award,,Lakshman Gunaratnam,,,* University of Western Ontario,Kidney Foundation of Canada and Canadian Institutes of Health Research,,CAD = Canadian dollar,,"$610,015.00","$210,000.00",Cash,0,35.00,Lakshman Gunaratnam,0,False,False,,

There is increasing concern that current non-invasive diagnostic paradigms used to identify CAD, and guide decisions towards coronary angiography and revascularization are not optimal. Currently, in many centres, there is an unacceptable rate of invasive coronary angiograms (in some centres up to 35%) which identify only non-obstructive CAD and/ or disease where revascularization may not alter clinical outcomes. Such results strongly suggest the need for improved non-invasive diagnostic strategies. While functional (ie: perfusion) imaging may therefore be of value, the most widely employed SPECT perfusion imaging remains limited in identifying some of the highest risk individuals, such as those with left main stem and/or multi-vessel disease. Indeed, these are the subset of patients where revascularization may provide the most meaningful improvement in hard clinical outcomes. Recently stress contrast enhanced cardiac CT scanning with state-of-art multi-row detector scanners has been shown to be a highly promising tool for the identification of functionally important coronary artery disease in single or multiple coronary vascular territories. However, in its current form, there remain a number of limitations that hamper its wide spread clinical implementation. Significant artifacts such as shading/beam hardening and the inability to accurately and reproducibly measure perfusion using semi-quantitative techniques are compounded by safety concerns regarding a relatively high radiation dose delivered. Objectives of the proposed research program We will develop a low radiation dose, dual energy CT scanning technique that is free of beam hardening effects and can measure myocardial perfusion at a radiation dose comparable to SPECT perfusion imaging. The proposed CT technique will then be validated in two stages. The first stage will be performed in pigs which distal LAD is ligated while the proximal artery is partially occluded to produce chronic myocardial ischemia plus infarction. CT measured myocardial perfusion (MPF) in normal and ischemic myocardium will be validated against fluorescent microsphere measurements in the same animal. The reproducibility of the CT technique will be estimated by repeat CT determinations of MPF in the same animal. After the pre-clinical validation stage, the CT technique will be used to measure myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR), which is the ratio of stress to rest MPF, in intermediate to high risk CAD patients and the results compared with those of SPECT perfusion imaging and coronary angiogram with fractional flow reserve (FFR) determination. These patient studies will show that the sensitivity and specificity of the CT technique are higher than those of SPECT perfusion imaging. Clinical significance of the proposed research program Subgroup analysis of data from the multicentre COURAGE trial showed that patients with ?10% ischemic myocardium had the largest rate of ischemia reduction following revascularization, and the largest reduction in unadjusted death or myocardial infarction following revascularization. As such, measurements of MPF and/or MPR to determine the percentage of ischemic myocardium are of paramount importance to guide treatment for patients with angina pectoris. Current clinical methods for evaluating myocardial ischemia are SPECT perfusion imaging and determination of FFR at invasive coronary angiography. The sensitivity of SPECT is expected to be low for left main and triple vessel disease because it is a relative technique for assessing MPF, while FFR is invasive. The CT technique will not have these drawbacks. The proposed CT MPF imaging method in combination with CT coronary angiography will provide a non-invasive and common imaging platform for the imaging of both coronary anatomy and myocardial perfusion. Based upon these recognized limitations there is a strong focus towards improvement in diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms for patients with chest discomfort. The aim of these improvements should be towards the improved accuracy of non-invasive testing, reduction in inappropriate invasive testing, and a downstream reduction in relevant clinical outcomes.

Osteoporosis-related fractures account for approximately 80% of fractures in Canadians >60 years old and are associated with decreased quality of life, independence and mobility and increased mortality (2;8;13;14). Canadian Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) suggest that bone mineral density (BMD) and clinical risk factors be used to determine fracture risk, and that those that high-risk receive treatment (15;18). Despite this, few who experience a fragility fracture are ever evaluated for osteoporosis and even fewer are treated. This care gap reinforces the need for improved uptake of current CPG. Barriers to uptake include a lack of knowledge about fracture risk factors and the interpretation of BMD results (36-45). To address this, a web-based tool, FRAX®, was developed by the World Health Organization and established as an international standard (70). This knowledge translation tool facilitates application of current CPG by integrating validated risk factors with BMD to estimate 10-year probability of fracture, thereby identifying patients who would benefit from treatment. The FRAX® tool is now validated in Canadians (74). It is important to evaluate whether this new tool enhances evidence-based practice in osteoporosis identification and management. This pilot study will compare the usability and impact of the FRAX® tool in primary care to current practice where physicians use standard BMD reports and their personal knowledge of patient's medical history in making treatment decisions. We hypothesize that family physicians will find FRAX® usable resulting in better identification of high-risk patients and increase managed rates for osteoporosis. Methods: Individuals ?50 years of age who have experienced a fall-related wrist fracture will be recruited through the Hand and Upper Limb Clinic (HULC) and referred for a BMD scan within one month of fracture. Participants’ family physicians will be allocated to receive a standard BMD report (group A, n=30) currently used at the HULC, or a FRAX® report (group B, n=30). Group allocation will occur by minimization where group assignment is used to balance the prognostic factors of age and BMD. The FRAX® report shows clinical risk factors for fracture and femoral neck BMD results and expresses a patient’s 10-year probability of hip or major osteoporotic fracture. Attached will be a print-out of treatment guidelines/recommendations from the Osteoporosis Canada website available online in October 2010. Three months later, family physicians in group B will be asked to complete an online questionnaire to assess the extent to which they understood how to interpret the FRAX® report and translate results into treatment decisions. Concurrently, the research assistant (RA) will phone each participant to inquire about the follow-up care they received from their family physician. The primary outcome will be appropriate guideline-concordant treatment, defined as a prescription for bisphosphonate, at three months. The RA will also review all participants' family practice charts to verify responses and ensure treatment was guideline-concordant. Secondary outcomes will include physicians’ ratings of the usefulness of the FRAX® versus standard BMD, and the assessment of barriers to using the tool. Recruitment/consent/retention rates will be calculated in this pilot study and will inform future planning of a multi-centre longitudinal study. Analyses, Results and Future Work: This pilot study will establish event rates with broad confidence intervals, response rates and variability estimates that will form the foundation of accurate analyses for future studies. A chi-square analysis will compare the proportions of treated participants in each group who have achieved the primary outcome at three months. Group treatment rates will provide parameter estimates which will inform legitimate sample size calculations based on realistic estimations of the magnitude of the participation rates and intervention effects. The recruitment rate and sample size will also us to determine the timeline and number of sites for a multi-centre fully powered cohort study. Questionnaire responses will inform us about physicians understanding of 10-year fracture risk output and the extent to which it can be translated into a treatment decision. These results will guide us in planning the intervention for the larger fully powered study. Capacity Building: The team consists of young and established researchers who have not previously collaborated; but have potential to conduct large clinical and cohort studies that would focus on bone health following fracture. The team would use this pilot data to establish a multi-center fully powered study; and incorporate new trainees into a bone health research program.",Clinical Trial,Research,Karen Beattie,"J Adachi, R Grewal, G Ioannidis, J Macdermid, A Hodsman",227587,* McMaster University,Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR),Catalyst Grant: Bone Health,CAD = Canadian dollar,,"$10,378,343.00",,Cash,1,3.00,"Kate Kelly, Clinical Research Coordinator, Hand and Upper Limb Center, St. Joseph's Health Care",0,False,False,,

Individuals with reduced kidney function have a complex bone disorder and may be at high risk of fragility fracture. We will conduct two cohort studies to better understand this relationship. Each study will focus on different stages of kidney function, one with marked reductions in kidney function (individuals with stages III and IV kidney function) and the other with more mild reductions in kidney function (living kidney donors, similar to stage II kidney function). In these studies, we will consider the primary outcome of fragility fractures: evidence of a lower extremity fracture (pelvis, hip, femoral shaft) or upper extremity fracture (radius, ulnar, humerus) not accompanied by major trauma. As done in standard practice, kidney function will be estimated with a formula that incorporates an individual’s serum creatinine value, age and sex (referred to as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)). --- Primary Research Questions 1. Do individuals with marked reductions in kidney function (i.e. stage III and IV kidney function, which is defined by an eGFR of 30-59 and 15-29 mL/min/1.73m2, respectively) have a higher risk of fragility fracture compared to individuals with an eGFR = 60 mL/min/1.73m2? 2. Do living kidney donors who are otherwise healthy individuals with a fixed, mild decrement in kidney function (similar to stage II kidney function, which is defined by an eGFR of 60-89 mL/min/1.73m2) have a higher risk of fragility fracture compared to a carefully selected comparison group of healthy non-donors. --- Hypotheses: We hypothesize that both marked and mild reductions in kidney function will be associated with an increased risk of fragility fracture. We expect the association to increase according to the degree of kidney function loss. --- Methods: We will conduct two retrospective cohort studies. Our data sources are Ontario’s large health care databases, held at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES). We will link two additional external databases in our data sources: i) Gamma-Dynacare data that currently contains 734,682 outpatient serum creatinine tests on adults = 65 years of age in Southwestern Ontario, and ii) Trillium Gift of Life data, where we manually reviewed the charts of over 2000 living kidney donors across five transplant programs. The period of study is January 1992 to March 2011. In the primary analysis of each study, we will compare fragility fracture rates in individuals with reduced kidney function (stage III or IV kidney function, or living kidney donors) to a referent kidney function group. We will use a negative binomial regression model, accounting for potential confounders via statistical adjustment or matching. In subgroup analyses, we will determine whether era, age, or gender modifies the observed association between reduced kidney function and fragility fracture. --- Research Team: We are a multi-disciplinary team experienced in clinical research, nephrology and osteoporosis. --- Timeline and Budget: The research will be conducted over a two year period, with a total budget of $99,624. --- Research Significance: Many older adults have stage III or IV kidney function (> 30% based on large population studies). If we determine that such individuals are at increased risk for fragility fracture, this will guide future intervention trials to help reduce this risk. In the case of living kidney donors, whether we observe an association or not will be entirely new knowledge, with the information gained playing an important role in the informed consent of potential donors.",Operating,Research,"GARG, Dr. Amit","J Adachi, S Cadarette, L-A Fraser, A.

Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) that results when there is temporary cessation and re-establishment of blood flow to the kidney is the most common cause of AKI. IRI is also an inevitable consequence of organ transplantation that, when severe, can limit the lifespan of the transplanted organ. Despite modern therapies, mortality rates and the poor outcomes after kidney transplantation associatednwith IRI remain largely unchanged. At the cellular level, IRI leads to massive death of kidney epithelial cells. The rapid removal of these dead cells occurs through a process known as ""phagocytosis"" that is vital to preventing further inflammation and hastening tissue repair. Recently, groups including ours discovered that surviving kidney epithelial cells express KIM-1, a gene product that transforms surviving kidney epithelial cells into phagocytes for clearance of dead or dying cells from the injured kidney. Emerging experimental evidence suggests that genetically engineered mice lacking the KIM-1 gene are more susceptible to inflammation and kidney dysfunction after IRI. Our research aims to understand the complex cell signalling pathways that govern how KIM-1 converts kidney epithelial cells to perform phagocytosis. In addition, we will test a novel therapeutic strategy that exploits this KIM-1-dependent kidney protective mechanism to enhance clearance of dead cells to ameliorate IRI in an animal model. We hope that our studies will lead to development of novel therapeutic strategies to improve renal recovery and potentially improve outcomes in AKI patients and kidney transplant recipients",Operating,Research,Lakshman Gunaratnam,,R4683A05,* University of Western Ontario,Kidney Foundation of Canada and Canadian Institutes of Health Research,KRESCENT,CAD = Canadian dollar,,"$37,235,503.00","$25,000.00",Cash,0,35.00,Lakshman Gunaratnam,0,False,False,,

(Ranked 2/11, Rated 4.18)","Team Grant, submitted Jan. 2012 (second application, SUMMARY The Problem: Distal radius fractures (DRF) are the most common of all fractures and, thus, improvements in management of this common injury can have a substantial population impact. The fracture is characterized by a bimodal epidemiology: young active individuals with higher trauma injuries and older individuals with low trauma injuries. Recent Cochrane reviews of the evidence indicate substantial deficiencies in the indications for fracture fixation and rehabilitation. In the younger adult, optimal fracture fixation is critical to achieving return to full function and prevention of traumatic arthritis. In older adults, fracture fixation has not been fully defined but is complicated by bone quality. Recovery of full function is possible, but potential adverse outcomes include chronic pain, malaligned fracture/post-traumatic arthritis, fear of falling/physical inactivity, chronic disablement/failure to return to work. Over the age of 50, a DRF is a signal that bone health should be investigated, but many patients do not receive bone health screening, or counseling around bone health. Conversely, since many DRF recover with optimal function, treating all patients with aggressive fracture fixation or rehabilitation protocols would place undue burden on the healthcare system. An algorithm which identifies individuals needing specific investigations and treatments is required to optimize management. An approach that includes standardized measurement of fracture outcomes is needed. Team Objective: The team will conduct a series of coordinated biomechanical, clinical, and knowledge translation research activities that address gaps in the current literature around DRF management to develop an evidence-based algorithm for initial care and optimizing of physical activity/bone health. Specific questions, research approaches to output into an evidence-based treatment algorithm 1. What is the impact of DRF malalignment, or different fracture fixations on kinematics of the radiocarpal and distal radioulnar joints? Approach = Kinematic modeling in cadaveric specimens. Output = Defining a critical acceptable point for fracture alignment (for testing in clinical studies). 2. What predicts the need for internal fixation in maintaining fracture alignment with an optimal outcome in specific subgroups? Approach = Prospective cohort study to identify fracture alignment variables that predict outcomes in younger and older adults. Output = Defined radiographic indicators for specific interventions (e.g., casting versus surgical/internal fixation). 3. What is the accuracy of a risk assessment screening tool in identifying individuals at risk of adverse fracture outcomes: bone health, psychosocial status (fear of falling), chronic pain, reduced physical activity and productivity (failure to return to work). Approach = A cohort design that will include a comprehensive risk assessment evaluation and standardized radiographic, functional, bone quality, general health status and physical activity outcomes. Output = Identified risk factors and their contribution to risk of specific outcomes to be incorporated in a targeted screening tool. 4. Does the implementation of fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) in orthopedic clinics result in an increase in appropriate screening and management of patients at risk of osteoporosis? Approach = A pre-post knowledge translation intervention study based on the findings of our current catalyst grant. Output = Screening tool. 5. What are the optimal measures for monitoring outcomes in DRF? Approach = Systematic review of radiographic, impairment, bone health and patient-reported outcomes appropriate for measuring clinical outcomes in DRF; participation in international consensus group establishing wrist outcome measures, conduct of systematic reviews. Output = Evidence and consensus-based recommendations for standardized outcome assessment for DRF. The Team: A team approach is needed to address the biomechanical and clinical aspects of DRF management since the solutions require understanding the interaction and knowledge translation to implement. The PI (JMD) is a productive clinical epidemiologist and knowledge translation expert with an extensive track record in DRF research (development of internationally used outcome measures, large prognostic cohort studies, health impacts of DRF).

Of note, many elderly are simultaneously at high risk of cardiovascular events and osteoporotic fracture. Arterial calcification and bone loss are measurable precursors, in that progession of arterial calcification is a marker of cardiovascular disease and sustained bone loss leads to osteoporosis. Vitamin D and calcium are cornerstones of osteoporosis therapy. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) reached a consensus on adequate intake for calcium and vitamin D for bone health. Whether the adequate intake is optimal for all health outcomes is unclear. Some studies have reported that high intakes of calcium or vitamin D or both may predispose to cardiovascular events and result in increased mortality. The upper limit of calcium intake was determined independent of vitamin D intake, but there is a known effect of vitamin D on calcium absorption. Thus, one immediate concern is the overall benefit versus risk of various combinations of calcium and vitamin D intake. This grant explores the hypothesis that excess calcium with concurrent high oral vitamin D intake or high serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) levels may lead to accelerated aortic calcification and subsequent cardiovascular events while providing no benefit in terms of fracture risk. We propose to study Canadian men and women aged 50 and older, who have been followed for over 10-years in the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos). We propose to study the following 1. The prevalence, severity, and longitudinal progression of aortic calcification 2. The age independent relationship between aortic calcification and BMD 3. The independent and joint effects of dietary and supplemental calcium and vitamin D on a. progression of aortic calcification b. risk of hospitalization for heart disease c. all cause mortality d. competing risk of fracture versus hospitalization for heart disease e. changes in serum biomarkers of relevance to mineralization The assessment of independent and joint effects of calcium and vitamin D will be done by consideration of the interaction of continuous variables, and stratification of calcium intake (low: 1200 mg/day) versus vitamin D intake (low: 800 IU/day). Assessment of effect will consider the possible impact of impaired renal function and concurrent use medications for osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. Significance: This study will aid in establishing optimal intakes of calcium and vitamin D that are beneficial for maintaining BMD and preventing fractures and that would not contribute to the progression of calcification or increased risk of cardiovascular events. This study will provide insight to pathophysiologic mechanisms and may determine useful biomarkers in guiding calcium and vitamin D therapy in different contexts, when individual risk factors such as age and kidney function should be taken into consideration.",Operating,Research,"GOLTZMAN, Dr. Daivd","J.

An important factor contributing to the myocardial fibrosis in DiCM is hyperglycemia associated with DM. The primary resident cell believed to be responsible for the extensive deposition of ECM (e.g., collagen) in DiCM is the cardiac fibroblast (CF). The overall goal of the present proposal is to use in vivo and in vitro models of DM to explore potential mechanisms involved in collagen production by the CFs. The proposed studies should increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of DiCM and provide a basis for the development of rational therapeutic approaches to prevent or arrest the progress of this cardiomyopathy. CFs are the major source of ECM proteins, such as collagens I, III, and IV. It is generally accepted that an important initiating event in collagen production by CFs is activation of PKC?2. Our preliminary data support this contention. Using an in vitro model involving exposure of isolated CFs to high concentrations of glucose (HG), we show that under these conditions the CFs produce collagen IV via a PKC? pathway IL-33, a member of the IL-1 cytokine family has recently been shown to exert a beneficial effect in various cardiac pathologies. However, it is not clear whether IL-33 can modulate the progression of DiCM. Our preliminary data using a streptozotocin (STZ) mouse model of DiCM indicate that the increase in myocardial collagen IV deposition and decrease in both systolic and diastolic function (Figure 3) is associated with a decreased myocardial IL-33 levels . Further, cardiac fibroblasts overexpressing IL-33 do not respond to HG with respect to collagen IV production . Exogenous IL-33 attenuates the DM-induced myocardial collagen deposition. Collectively, our preliminary studies suggest that a myocardial IL-33 deficiency may contribute to the pathogenesis of DiCM. One potential endogenous mechanism by which IL-33 synthesis can be modulated is by the generation of microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are short (approximately 22-nucleotides) RNAs that modulate gene expression by base pairing with the 3’ untranslated regions (3’-UTRs) of mRNAs and inhibiting translation or promoting degradation. Based on literature and miRNA target prediction tools[TargetScan (www.targetscan.org) and MirTarget(www.mirdb.org)] analyses, miR-380-5p may be targeting IL-33 expression. Our preliminary data indicate that diabetes results in elevated myocardial levels of microRNA-380-5p (miR-380-5p) and a decreased myocardial IL-33 expression . Based on preliminary results, we propose the following working hypothesis: Diabetic myocardial dysfunction is due to downregulation of IL-33 by miR-380-5p in resident CFs which results in increased collagen synthesis and deposition. We will use in vitro approaches to study the causal relationships among miR-380-5p, IL-33, and collagen (I and IV) production in CFs challenged with HG. In addition, various salient components of the working hypothesis will be assessed in vivo using both type I (STZ) and type II (leptin receptor deficient) mouse models of DM. Specifically, we will test this hypothesis in three Specific Aims: 1) To assess whether challenge of CFs with HG results in an increase in collagen I and IV production via a PKC? pathway; whether IL-33 can modulate the PKC? pathway through regulating DGK? expression, and the mechanism(s) involved in regulation of DGK? by IL-33. Specifically, whether down regulation of IL-33 is a prerequisite for HG-induced CF collagen production. 2) To assess whether miR-380-5p is involved in the downregulation of IL-33 in CFs challenged with HG. Specifically, whether inhibition of miR-380-5p can result in increase in IL-33 production and a decrease in collagen expression by CFs with HG. 3) To assess whether miR-380-5p and IL-33 play a role in myocardial fibrosis and myocardial dysfunction in both type I (streptozotocin) and type II (leptin receptor deficient) murine models of diabetes.",Operating,Research,Tao Rui,,,* LHRI,HSFO,,CAD = Canadian dollar,,"$51,056,199.00",$100.00,Cash,0,20.00,,1,False,False,,

International reports indicate patients that require long-term mechanical ventilation account for up to 10% of all mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care units (ICUs), 40% of ICU bed days, and 50% of ICU costs posing substantial burden on constrained critical care resources. In Canada availability of inpatient bed capacity in specialized weaning facilities and institutional long-term care is limited meaning many long-term ventilated patients have protracted ICU stays. An additional consideration is that ICUs are generally not resourced to provide the rehabilitative focus required for this patient population. We propose to hold a workshop to draw together a community of key stakeholders to: (1) identify issues and priorities arising from the recently developed Canadian guidelines for long-term ventilation; (2) inform key stakeholders of current best practice models; (3) determine goals, objectives, and methods for a research agenda focused on optimizing seamless and timely transitions through the continuum of care; and (4) facilitate collaborative relationships and partnering for future research projects. Approximately 30 to 40 people will attend with representation across Canada including researchers and decision makers interested in working collaboratively to develop a research agenda and action plan, and to generate a vision of optimal transition across the continuum of care. Anticipated outcomes of this workshop will be to: (1) foster better health and quality of life for long-term ventilated patients; (2) develop targeted research that addresses current gaps to be translated into practice; (3) increase use of current best practices based on quality research; and (4) encourage coordinated, focused data collection relevant to long-term ventilated patients.","Meetings, Planning and Dissemination Grant",,"ROSE, Louise","FRASER, Ian; GOLDSTEIN, Roger; LEASA, David; MAWDSLEY, Cathy; MCKIM, Douglas",,* University of Toronto,Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR),"Meetings, Planning and Dissemination Grant: Circul",CAD = Canadian dollar,,"$67,584,699.00",,,0,,,0,False,False,,

Inefficient weaning may result in prolonged time on a ventilator putting patients at risk of lung injury, pneumonia, and death. Certain patients may require ventilation for weeks or longer and present greater difficulties in discontinuing support. At times delivery of the most effective and efficient care may be difficult due to organizational constraints. Weaning protocols (written guidance on the weaning process) and computerized weaning programs are advocated as solutions to inefficient weaning methods. By conducting three evidence syntheses we aim to identify factors affecting the use and effect of weaning protocols and computerized weaning programs on reducing the time spent on a ventilator, and to describe weaning methods, types of institutions providing care, and weaning success for patients requiring ventilation for more than three weeks. Where appropriate, we will use knowledge synthesis methods outlined by the Cochrane Collaboration, an independent organization dedicated to making up-to-date, accurate information about the effects of health care readily available worldwide. Our team includes national and international experts on ventilator weaning. Knowledge users include doctors and respiratory therapists from specialized weaning centres, intensive care units providing care to adults and children, and individuals who have experienced weaning. Our knowledge users will assist us to identify the best strategies to ensure the knowledge we develop reaches our target audience, and to develop methods to overcome barriers to implementation of our findings.

To do so, care coordination and collaboration was not only needed among multiple healthcare professionals and sites but also between providers, patients and their families. At the beginning of this project our objectives were to: 1. Define and build a regional inter-professional system that optimizes the delivery of care to the LTV patient, and those ‘at risk’ of becoming, ventilator-dependent. 2.

When patients develop ALI, they often require a life support machine or mechanical ventilator (MV) to keep them alive; however the MV itself can cause damage to the lungs, often worsening the illness. This eventually results in inflammation, which can spill over from the lung into the bloodstream and affect other organs such as the liver or kidneys. When other organs become damaged there is a dramatic increase in the number of patients that die as a result of ALI. Despite more than 30 years of research in this area, there is currently no effective treatment for these patients. Recently, our lab has found that genetically-modified animals that have high levels of cholesterol in their blood were more susceptible to ALI than normal animals. The results of this study are important for several reasons; i) this observation has never been described before, ii) elevated cholesterol levels are a common and growing problem in North America, and iii) if patients with high cholesterol levels can be identified early, more effective treatment options may be available to minimize the severity of this disease. This grant will therefore help in developing better treatment options for this devastating condition, and also minimize health care costs associated with ALI. B) Objectives – Specific Aims #1-3 will address the following questions; 1) Do high levels of cholesterol predispose patients to be more susceptible to a specific type of injury to the lungs? ii) Does the ventilator itself cause more damage in the setting of high cholesterol levels? and iii) Does high cholesterol lead to an increased risk of damage to other organs in ALI? Specific Aim #4 will be to determine if animals with high cholesterol levels due to high dietary cholesterol intake have the same susceptibility as the genetically-modified animals. C) How Will We Study This? – We are using genetically modified mice that have high cholesterol levels as these types of studies are not feasible to perform in humans. Firstly, we will determine whether these animals show any difference based on the type of injury they sustain by comparing a model of stomach aspiration (by instilling acid into the lungs) with a model of pneumonia (by instilling a substance called LPS that mimics infection) and see if there is a difference in lung damage and inflammation. Secondly, we will compare ventilator technique to determine if these mice with high cholesterol levels are more susceptible to a specific mode of life support. Thirdly, we will measure inflammatory molecules released by the lung to determine if high cholesterol levels impact on this problem. Finally, we will feed normal mice a high fat and cholesterol diet for 4 weeks and do similar experiments and compare the results to the genetically modified animals. D) Why is This Unique/Relevant to the Mission Statement? – Although elevated levels of cholesterol are an important contributor to the development of heart disease, it is unknown whether cholesterol can also lead to problems with the lungs. In some preliminary experiments, we tested genetically modified animals and found they were indeed susceptible. We want to expand our research in this area to determine how this susceptibility occurs, and whether it may be applicable to patients with high cholesterol. This is unique and important information which could potentially lead to new therapies for ALI and possibly other lung diseases prevalent in Canadians such as asthma and pneumonia.",Operating,Research,Dr. Cory Yamashita,,,* The Lung Assocition,Ontario Thoracic Society,,CAD = Canadian dollar,,"$52,017,072.00","$49,400.00",,0,,,0,False,False,,

An asthma action plan (AAP) is a personalized form filled out by a health care professional for each individual patient with asthma, which provides the patient with instructions on what to do when symptoms become more active. Studies have shown that AAPs decrease patient symptoms, urgent doctor visits, and emergency room visits, and improve patients’ quality of life. However, only 11% of Canadian asthma patients report having received an asthma action plan. The main reasons for this are that doctors do not have the skills and time required to prepare AAPs for individual patients. b) Objective of your project We developed the Electronic Asthma Action Plan System (eAAPS) to enable health care professionals to quickly and easily prepare and deliver AAPs to their patients with asthma. Our system employs a portable computer in the doctor's waiting room which patients use to answer a simple set of questions about their asthma. Our system uses these answers to automatically generate an AAP that is tailored to the patient, which then gets transmitted to the electronic medical record system, for easy delivery from the health care professional to the patient. Since most clinics do not have a waiting room computer, the goal of this study is to develop a Smartphone application (“app”) that patients can use to complete the waiting room questionnaire on their personal Smartphones. c) How will you undertake your work? With a dedicated and experienced information technology team, we will develop the Smartphone app and test it in 3 to 4 focus groups consisting of patients with asthma, seeking their feedback to ensure that it is easy to understand and simple to use. We will run these focus group sessions one after the other, analyzing information after each one, making improvements to the app, and presenting the improved version to the next group. We will then integrate the final version of the app into the eAAPS and offer it to patients at a Family Health Clinic as part of a larger study measuring whether the eAAPS can increase the frequency of AAP delivery by health care professionals to their patients. d) What is unique/innovative about your project? This project is innovative in that it engages patients to take part in their own health care, which is something that asthma patients frequently express a desire to do. Both by completing the questionnaire about their asthma, and by receiving an AAP and using it to self-manage their asthma symptoms, patients will become active partners in their care. Furthermore, this project uses cutting-edge technology in the form of a Smartphone app and a computerized system to process data and to communicate with the electronic medical record system. By using latest technology, we both engage the patient, and remove barriers to better care by the health care practitioner. e) A clear and concise description of how the proposed research is relevant to the Lung Association’s mission statement, i.e. how will the outcomes of your project improve the lung health of Canadians. This research directly improves management of lung disease by enabling more patients with asthma to receive an AAP, which has major proven beneficial effects on patient health. Our technology will be designed so that it can be adapted to work with various different electronic medical record systems. As such, we plan to eventually make it available to patients and clinics across the country, in a nationwide lung health initiative. We hope to improve not only the way that heath care is delivered, but also the everyday health of the 3 million asthma sufferers in Canada.",Clinical Trial,Research,Dr. Samir Gupta,"Sharon Strauss, Louis-Philippe Boulet, Anthony Levinson, David Chan, Gina Agarwal, Muhammad Mamdani, Joseph Cafazzo, Joanna Sale",,,Ontario Lung Association/Ontario Thoracic Society,,CAD = Canadian dollar,,"$45,705,148.00",,,0,2.00,,0,False,False,,

The term describes a condition in which patients who emerge from coma appear to be awake, but show no signs of awareness. The minimally conscious state (MCS) is a related condition in which patients show inconsistent signs of awareness. In both cases, it is extremely difficult to assess residual brain function using standard clinical methods, leading to an alarmingly high rate of misdiagnosis (43%). In a series of recent studies, we have demonstrated that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalograpy (EEG) can identify residual cognitive function, and even awareness, in some patients who are assumed to be VS or MCS, but still have abilities that cannot be detected using standard clinical methods. This new proposal builds on these studies in a number of important ways. First, we will apply our new methods to a large group of Canadian VS and MCS patients in order to establish how frequently aspects of cognitive function (including awareness and the ability to communicate using EEG or fMRI) are preserved and whether these covert signs can inform diagnosis and prognosis. We will also use state-of-the-art structural neuroimaging to determine why some of these patients remain conscious, yet behaviourally entirely non-responsive. Finally, for the first time, we will use our methods in the intensive care unit setting, to assess residual cognitive function in patients who are still comatose. This research will have a profound and direct impact on the assessment, diagnosis and clinical care of patients with severe brain injury and will have significant implications for the delivery of health care resources across Canada.

The average survival after diagnosis is less than 3 years. The incidence of IPF has been constantly increasing in the last 20 years. There is currently no widely approved treatment for IPF. However, the present time is indeed a very exciting one for IPF researchers as, for the first time, there has been an increasing interest from pharmaceutical industries in investing in clinical trials for IPF. These trials necessitate a reliable endpoint, a parameter that can measure whether the therapy is working or not. Unfortunately in IPF there is no such validated parameter. Recently, a number of biomarkers measurable in the blood of patients have been described. These have shown the potential to reflect disease severity and disease activity. However, none of them has been validated as a factor capable to predict outcome in patients with IPF consistently followed over an extended period of time. The purpose of this study is to establish which biomarker in the blood is the best predictor of survival and of progression of disease. Patients with IPF will be seen every 4 months for a period of 2 years and at each visit the level of 6 different biomarkers will be measured in the blood. Using accurate statistical methods, we will establish which biomarker is the best predictor of survival and disease progression in IPF.",Operating,Research,Marco Mura,,,,Western University,RW INTERNAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS - WESTERN STRATEGIC SUPPORT FOR CIHR SUCCESS - SEED GRANT - 2013 FALL COMPETITION,CAD = Canadian dollar,,"$10,851,280.00",,,0,,,0,False,False,,

We propose to use two well-established provincial population-based cohorts (asthma and COPD) to measure environmental-related health effects. These cohorts are population-based and offer a cost-effective and unique opportunity to identify and follow incident cases, study the concentration-response relationship of air pollution and climate change on the progression of disease, and identify locations and population groups at greatest risk for specific respiratory health threats during smog days and extreme heat/cold waves. Objectives: To use population-based epidemiological data to measure respiratory health effects of individual air pollutants and climate change and to identify high-risk subpopulations or clusters. Research Questions: *What are the effects of different air pollutants and climate mixtures on the development, exacerbations and progression of asthma and COPD? *Are there subgroups of the population (age, sex, rural/urban living, SES, smoking and other factors) that are more susceptible to adverse respiratory health effects of air pollution and climate change?",Clinical Trial,Research,Dr. Shawn Aaron,"To,T., Gershon, A., Lougheed, D., Villeneuve, P., Chen, H., Crighton, E., Su, Y.",,External,Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR),The Canadian Respiratory Research Network: Origin and Progression of Airway Disease,CAD = Canadian dollar,,"$58,323,329.00",,Cash,1,,,0,False,False,,

The prognosis of UIP is much worse than that of NSIP. The two conditions require different treatment. The distinction between UIP and NSIP is often very challenging from a clinical and radiographic standpoint. We previously investigated gene expression patterns from lung tissues obtained from patients with UIP or NSIP at the time of LTx, and identified some potential, specific markers at the genetic level of each condition. B) Hypothesis. We hypothesize that the differential expression of 8 specific genes found in UIP and NSIP will be confirmed at the protein level, providing novel markers for these two conditions. C) Methods. To detect the specific proteins that we have selected, we will perform immunohistochemistry studies on lung tissues previously obtained with surgical biopsies from patients with UIP or NSIP. We will investigate whether these markers are specific for UIP and NSIP, respectively. Tissue blocs will be obtained from the archive of the Department of Pathology, Western University.D) Expected Results and Significance. The confirmation of the differental expression of different markers for UIP and NSIP at the protein level will be instrumental in the advancement of the differential diagnosis between these two conditions, and will provide new insight into the pathogenesis of UIP and NSIP.",Operating,Research,Marco Mura,Dr. Christopher Howlett,,Lawson,Lawson Research Institute,LAWSON INTERNAL RESEARCH FUND,CAD = Canadian dollar,,"$11,095,552.00",,,0,,,0,False,False,,

It is planned to recruit all 50 current patients of the ILD clinic at Victoria Hospital in London, Ontario. Project investigators will collect food, beverage and supplement intake data using a 24-hr food recall and a 3-day food intake record. A review of blood work history will be compared against these analyses. Additional values including but not limited to energy needs, percent body fat and body water will be measured using a BodyStat® Analyzer machine.

However, major gaps and obstacles prevent transplantation from being fully effective. We need to develop new knowledge, policies and health care practices to overcome these barriers. Our transplant research team brings together researchers and stakeholders across Canada from many disciplines to work in an integrated and coordinated manner to increase and improve the promise of transplantation as a 'second chance' at health for Canadians. Our research program will unify the following projects: 1) Improving organs for transplant through targeted organ protection and repair 2) Increasing organ and cell donation through improved donor identification 3) Examining biologic markers of early problems in transplant function and identifying targets for drug treatments 4) Implementing strategies to avoid rejection of transplants and side-effects of medication 5) Predicting and preventing viral complications of transplantation 6) Targeting age-related and health care system problems experienced by children and teenagers with transplants. To support these innovative projects, our program will integrate the management of experimental protocols, data, clinical trials, biobanks and registries across all studies. A core team will examine ethical, economic, legal and social issues related to transplantation. Our team's critical priorities include creating and sharing knowledge with a wide range of stakeholders and training new transplant researchers to sustain progress into the future. Overall, we aim to achieve improvements to donation effectiveness, to transplant policies and processes and to individual transplant outcomes. By increasing the effectiveness of donation and transplantation, the proposed research will substantially improve the health of Canadians who are candidates for and recipients of solid organ and bone marrow transplants.",Operating,Research,Dr. Lori West,"ESDALE, Barbara K; FAIRHEAD, Todd R; FIFIELD, Tammy; GAVSIE, Ronnie; MACDONALD, Nancy; MARCUS, Sharon; MARSHALL, John C; NICHOLAS, David B; RUSH, David N; SMITH, David A; WORTON, Kim; YOUNG, Kimberly P; ABBEY, Susan E; ALLEN, Upton D; ALWAYN, Ian P; BERGERON, John J; BERTHIAUME, Yves; BLYDT-HANSEN, Tom; BROADY, Raewyn; BUSQUE, Stephan; CAILHIER, Jean-Francois; CARDINAL, Héloise; CATTRAL, Mark S; CHANDLER, Jennifer A; CHASSE, Michael; CHRUSCINSKI, Andrzej J; COLLETTE, Suzon; DEVINS, Gerald M; DH",,External,CIHR,Transplantation Research - Full Application,CAD = Canadian dollar,,"$39,458,656.00",,Cash,0,,,0,False,False,,

It is the most common cause of hospitalization in older adults. The month after discharge from hospital represents a vulnerable period during which patients are at increased risk worsening symptoms and death. One in five patients are readmitted during this period, which burdens patients and is expensive to the health care system. Research has shown that certain discharge-planning services can reduce both readmissions and death after hospitalization. However, these services are not routinely offered at hospitals because they require coordination across health care settings and professionals, which is a challenge in health care systems. In this study, we will group together several proven-effective discharge-planning services into 'Patient-centered Care Transitions in Heart Failure' (PACT-HF). This model of care aims to prepare patients for the transition from hospital to home and ensure continuity of care after discharge. Through PACT-HF, patients will benefit from a complete assessment of their health care needs, learn how to recognize and manage symptoms of HF, and receive the information and follow-up care needed to optimize their health. We will roll out the PACT-HF model of care to 16 hospitals over a number of time-periods such that one-by-one, all hospitals will have PACT-HF implemented. We will compare the outcomes of patients in hospitals receiving PACT-HF with those in hospitals not receiving PACT-HF. We anticipate that patients hospitalized at the sites receiving PACT-HF will have fewer readmissions, emergency room visits, and deaths; feel more prepared for discharge; and have a better quality of life after discharge. We also anticipate that PACT-HF will reduce health care costs due to fewer readmissions after hospital discharge.",Clinical Trial,Research,"CONNOLLY, Stuart James ; VAN SPALL, Harriette","GRAHAM, Ian D. ; HAYNES, Robert Brian ; HEFFERNAN, Michael L. ; LAMY, André ; MAINGI, Manish ; POREPA, Liane ; RICCI, Joseph A. ; SUSKIN, Neville Gordon ; TEO, Koon Kang ; THABANE, Lehana ; TJANDRAWIDJAJA, Michael",,,Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR),Partnerships for Health System Improvement (PHSI),CAD = Canadian dollar,,"$15,559,097.00",,,0,5.00,Navigator,1,False,False,,

International reports indicate patients that require long-term mechanical ventilation account for up to 10% of all mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care units (ICUs), 40% of ICU bed days, and 50% of ICU costs posing substantial burden on constrained critical care resources. In Canada availability of inpatient bed capacity in specialized weaning facilities and institutional long-term care is limited meaning many long-term ventilated patients have protracted ICU stays. An additional consideration is that ICUs are generally not resourced to provide the rehabilitative focus required for this patient population. We propose to hold a workshop to draw together a community of key stakeholders to: (1) identify issues and priorities arising from the recently developed Canadian guidelines for long-term ventilation; (2) inform key stakeholders of current best practice models; (3) determine goals, objectives, and methods for a research agenda focused on optimizing seamless and timely transitions through the continuum of care; and (4) facilitate collaborative relationships and partnering for future research projects. Approximately 30 to 40 people will attend with representation across Canada including researchers and decision makers interested in working collaboratively to develop a research agenda and action plan, and to generate a vision of optimal transition across the continuum of care. Anticipated outcomes of this workshop will be to: (1) foster better health and quality of life for long-term ventilated patients; (2) develop targeted research that addresses current gaps to be translated into practice; (3) increase use of current best practices based on quality research; and (4) encourage coordinated, focused data collection relevant to long-term ventilated patients.","Meetings, Planning and Dissemination Grant",,"ROSE, Louise","FRASER, Ian Murray ; GOLDSTEIN, Roger S. ; LEASA, David John ; MAWDSLEY, Cathy ; MCKIM, Douglas",,* University of Toronto,Canadian Lung Association (CLA),"Meetings, Planning and Dissemination Grant: Circul",CAD = Canadian dollar,,"$30,092,814.00",,,0,,,0,False,False,,

While weight loss is the most effective therapy for NAFLD, our efforts are failing and in the next generation it will become the most common cause of liver failure in Canada. Recently, researchers have focused on the potential use of altering the composition of bacteria in the gut (microbiome) to alter absorption of energy from food, deposition of fat and resistance to insulin. This study will determine if transplantation of bacteria from the stool of a healthy volunteer into an individual with metabolic syndrome and NAFLD (i.e. fecal microbiota transplant/FMT) can alter insulin resistance and reduce the amount of fat deposited in the liver.

Delirium is very common in the seriously ill elderly and has been associated with worse patient outcomes. It is also very distressing for patients’ families. A landmark study demonstrated that maintaining normal patient blood sugars improves outcomes in ICU patients. Further studies have suggested that it may be more harmful to patients to cause their blood sugar levels to fluctuate, than to allow them to stay mildly elevated, but consistent. The relationship between blood sugar levels and delirium is incompletely understood. Research Question: Is the absolute value, or variation of patients’ blood sugar, more strongly linked with delirium? Hypothesis: In an elderly (over 65 years old), critically ill population, fluctuations in blood sugar are more strongly associated with the presence of delirium than maintaining a normal absolute value. We propose to perform a chart review to evaluate the effectiveness of our current protocols to control blood sugar levels in elderly patients. We will examine the relationship between blood sugar levels and delirium in this patient population. We will also gather data on other factors that may contribute to delirium including: age, gender, diagnosis, duration of hospital stay prior to ICU admission, duration of ICU admission, past medical history, exposure to sedating medications, presence or absence of a window in the ICU room, interruption of sedating medication use, continuous infusions versus intermittent use of sedating medications, and patient frailty.",Prospective Cohort Study,,Spencer Chambers,"Claudio Martin, Brenda Morgan",,Lawson,Tech Value Net,Summer Student Research Project,CAD = Canadian dollar,,"$39,239,907.00",$0.00,Cash,0,2.00,Summer Medical Student,0,True,False,,

ILDs include many complex diseases ranging from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and connective tissue disease-associated ILD, to occupational lung disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and sarcoidosis. Accurate diagnosis is often challenging and treatment decisions are complex, with some emerging treatment options becoming available. The diagnosis and management of ILD requires the combined expertise of respirologists, radiologists, pathologists and, when appropriate, thoracic surgeons and rheumatologists. A prompt and accurate diagnosis is critical to the management of patients with ILD. Different studies showed that delayed diagnosis and access to a specialized ILD centre translates into a worse quality of life and outcome, and/or late referral to lung transplantation, resulting in the premature death of potentially eligible patients. Unfortunately many patients with ILD are referred late to a specialized care centre. With the incidence of IPF on a constant rise, poorly managed ILD carries a significant impact on healthcare resources. We hypothesize that improved quality of life and survival of patients with ILD, as well as reduced healthcare resource utilization will result from: I. a shorter time from onset of symptoms to referral to the dedicated ILD clinic, by raising awareness of ILD among both community and academic physicians; II. a proactive, multidisciplinary approach from respirologists, radiologists and pathologists to the diagnosis and management of patients with ILD, with the Respirology ILD clinic taking the responsibility of ownership of patients; III. comprehensive medical care, including cutting edge therapeutic options, clinical trials, close collaboration between respirologists and rheumatologists, physiotherapy, optimization of nutritional status, treatment of comorbidities, and timely referral to lung transplantation of appropriate candidates. We will prospectively follow for a period of 3 years all new patients referred to the ILD clinic and compare outcomes and healthcare resource utilization in patients with early (?6 months from onset of symptoms) vs. late referral, and in a historical cohort of patients with ILD, before the institution of the ILD clinic. The endpoints will be total survival, progression-free survival and total number of healthcare resources (hospitalizations, outpatient physician visits, laboratory tests, diagnostic tests). We anticipate that patients with appropriately early referral to the ILD clinic will have a significantly better outcome and utilize significantly less healthcare resources than those with late referral.",Operating,Research,Dr. Marco Mura,,,Lawson,Academic Medical Organization of Southwestern Ontario (AMOSO),AMOSO Opportunity Fund,CAD = Canadian dollar,,"$34,310,187.00",,Cash,0,,,0,False,False,,

While the possibility of surviving cardiac disease is greater today than 10 years ago, these patients are now at a higher risk for dementia, accelerated cardiovascular disease, and stroke. A common denominator in each of these outcomes is impairment of the vascular system in the brain. However, few studies have addressed this problem. Our recent findings indicate that both the thickness of the outer layer of the brain (the cortex) and its blood supply can increase in many of these patients who perform six months of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation. This study will test the hypothesis that cerebrovascular health is diminished in these patients due to damage to the layer of cells that line the blood vessels called the endothelium. The study will evaluate first the impact of ischemic heart disease and cardiac rehabilitation on a comprehensive array of cerebrovascular outcomes using state-of-the art imaging techniques, and second, the impact that inflammation has on brain blood vessel health. These studies will benefit not only patients with cardiac and cerebrovascular disease, but also lead to a broader understanding of how exercise affects brain health.",Operating,Research,Kevin Shoemaker,"Cepinskas, Gediminas; Daley, Mark J; Dekaban, Gregory A; Fraser, Douglas D; St. Lawrence, Keith S; Summers, Kelly; Suskin, Neville G",,Western,Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR),,,,"$33,687,059.00",,Cash,1,,,0,False,False,,
